I began working on a sequel to my first Xbox Live Indie Game in 2013. I was not able to complete the game before graduating from college and starting my first full-time job. Over the years I worked on the project from time to time, but eventually the Xbox Live Indie Games Marketplace service was shutdown for developers. The game will compile and work for PCs, but support for XNA was also discontinued. Without a platform to release the game on, my motivation to complete the game diminished. Hopefully one day I can revive this code and release the game somewhere.

All shaders were written in HLSL 3.0 in order to compile for the Xbox 360.
